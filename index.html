			<p>Welcome to Metrosynth! Metrosynth is a software-based synthesizer (softsynth) inspired by the Washington D.C. Metro.</p>
			<p>Metrosynth takes a waveform generated by an oscillator, passes it through various filters, and finally outputs it through your speakers.</p>
			<p>See those colored dots on the map? The ones that say “Osc” and then a number? We start there. Pick any of those oscillators, and click and drag from that station to a white station. White stations represent filters, and passing your signal through filters can have interesting effects on the final sound you create.</p>
			<p>Now you should see a solid colored line leading from the oscillator to the filter. That means it’s properly connected. If you see a dotted line, it means something went wrong, or you didn't start from an oscillator—delete the connection by clicking on the red “x” that appears when you hover over the line, and try again.</p>
			<p>Now that you’ve got your oscillator connected to a filter, let’s listen to what we’ve got. Click on the filter and drag until you get to a black station—any of the ones that say “Out” and then a number. The number doesn’t have to be the same as the oscillator you started at—those are just the beginning and endpoints of the real-life Metro lines. Once you’ve connected your line to an output, you should be able to hear your signal and see its waveform below.</p>
			<p>Experiment with different lines, filters, and oscillators, and make your own personal sound and Metro map!</p>

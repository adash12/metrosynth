			<h1>Metrosynth</h1>
			<p>Welcome to Metrosynth! Metrosynth is a software-based synthesizer (softsynth) inspired by the Washington D.C. Metro.</p>
			<p>Metrosynth works by taking a waveform generated by an oscillator, passing it through various filters, and finally outputting it through your speakers.</p>
			<p>Let's get started then! See those colored dots on the map? The ones that say "Osc" and then a number? We start there. Pick any of those oscillators, and click and drag from that station to a white station. White stations represent filters, and passing your signal through filters can have interesting effects on the final sound you create.</p>
			<p>Alright, now you should see a solid colored line leading from the oscillator to the filter. That means it's properly connected. If you see a dotted line, it means something went wrong - delete the connection by clicking on the red 'x' that appears when you hover over the line, and try again.</p>
			<p>Now that you've got your oscillator connected to a filter, let's take a listen to what we've got. Click on the filter and drag until you get to a black station - any of the ones that say "Out" and then a number. The number doesn't have to be the same as the oscillator you started at - those are just the beginning and endpoints of the real-life Metro lines. Once you've connected your line to an output, you should be able to hear your signal and see its waveform below. Nice job!</p>
			<p>Keep experimenting with different lines, filters, and oscillators, and make your own personal sound and Metro map.</p>
